# Deepfake Image Detection

A Python-based application for detecting deepfake images using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as real or fake.

## ✨ Features
- Detects deepfake images using a trained CNN model
- Simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction
- Provides real-time results for image classification

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tkinter
